  <p><b><em>The Bible is the Holy Book of the Christian faith.</em></b> It is a collection of various writings that all point to the
  redemptive movement of God throughout history. The Bible covers many topics from the creation of the world to the
  history of the nation of Israel and of course the life, teaching, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
